# Changelog for the python-template

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
The project uses semantic versioning (see [semver](https://semver.org)), though
templating versions are not perfect matches for semantic versions.

## [Unreleased]

## v1.0.0 - 2023-05-02

- New python template using `copier>=7.1.0`, validated by tests and
  teaching/explaining itself via design document.
