# Changelog for the python-template

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
The project uses semantic versioning (see [semver](https://semver.org)), though
templating versions are not perfect matches for semantic versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Markdown support in python docstrings, via
  [myst-parser](myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) and [sphinx-autodoc2](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#using-markdown-myst-docstrings)

### Fixed
- Template self-tests now refer properly to current `HEAD` commit, not last tagged
- Fix pytest warnings via update of `pytest-coverage` to `4.*`


## v1.0.0 - 2023-05-02

### Added

- New python template using `copier>=7.1.0`, validated by tests and
  teaching/explaining itself via design document.
